# personal-website

This repo contains the code used for my [personal website](http://clementprodhomme.fr).

## Run locally

Before everything, install the Node modules and gulp globally:
```
npm install
npm install -g gulp
```

After type `npm run start` in a terminal and there you go.

A new tab will be open in your browser at `localhost:3000` but you won't be able to see anything as the website is localized in three languages: English, Spanish and French. To see each individual versions, go to `/index-{{en|es|fr}}.html`.

## Reuse the code

### I18n

The only html file is `src/index.html` which compiles several copies into `dist/` according to the languages you want to support. To add a new one, add a new folder in `src/lang/` with the name of the new language. Inside it, create an `index.json` file with all the translations you need.

These translations can be used in your HTML files with the special markup of the plugin [gulp-html-i18n](https://github.com/webyom/gulp-html-i18n). Please refer to it to see the options.

### htaccess

Note that the repo comes with an advanced `.htaccess` file to nicely rewrite the URLs. The rules are easy and commented. Here is the summary:

- A request to `/` will redirect the users to `/{{en|es|fr}}` depending on the language set by the browser
- Loading `/{{en|es|fr}}` will load the file `/index-{{en|es|fr}}.html`
- All the other assets are loaded from the root folder
- 404 errors redirect to the root path

### Miscellaneous

Please take care to remove all the references to the analytics tool used by the website. If you wanna take a look at it, see [Piwik](http://piwik.org).
