The only constant is working on something meaningful.</p><p>I consider myself social, empathetic, and curious while also being responsible, organised and proactive. As a team player, I like to encourage, mentor, and celebrate others.</p><p>Outside of work, I like to give back by volunteering at various associations that align with my values.</p></div><h2>Work experience</h2><div class="c-experience"><h3><a class="-primary" href="http://www.vizzuality.com/" rel="noopener">Vizzuality</a></h3><span>since Feb 2015</span><p>I develop multiple highly interactive web applications each year focusing on complex charts, maps, and geospatial analysis in cross-functional teams of 5 to 10.
